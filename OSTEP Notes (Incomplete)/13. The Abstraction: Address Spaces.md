# 13. The Abstraction: Address Spaces

## Introduction

One process came, ran, and then was removed from memory by the os once it was done.

Now, in the era of **multi programming**, we wanted *efficiency* and *utilization*. We did this by switching between multiple processes.

Again, people wanted more, so we started looking at **time sharing**. We obviously can't save all the contents of the memory to the hard disk. Solution: Let the processes keep the assigned spaces on the address space.

Now, the idea is that each program is treated like a god (from the perspective of a program). It is given space like so:

## Goals
1. **Transparency**: Each process thinks its god and the virtualization should be so good that it doesn't know otherwise
2. **Efficiency**: Space and Time
3. **Protection**: Each process is protected from other processes. Even the OS protects itself from getting into its own address space.
