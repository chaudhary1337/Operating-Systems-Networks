# 6. Mechanism: Limited Direct Execution
###### tags: `OSTEP`

As we saw previously, **time sharing** is one of the ways we can virtualise CPU. However, there are challenges building it.
- **Performance**: There are overheads between switching processes.
- **Control**: How do we properly assign permissions?


## The Protocol of Limited Direct Execution
Process Creation

## Problem 1: Restricted Operations
- if a process runs only on CPU natively, no issue
- if a process needs disk access/more memory (RAM), then we have an issue
- we obviously can't give every process all the permissions
- we now need two modes: **user** and **kernel** mode
    - user mode: if process requests I/O: it fails and OS kills it.
    - kernel mode: god mode. everything is allowed
- user -(`trap` instruction)->-(system call)-> kernel -(`return-from-trap` instruction)-> user
    - here we execute `trap` instruction to 'trap' a part of the kernel
    - this lets us execute system calls
    - the OS then tells processor to push the caller's information on the **kernel stack**
    - then pops them off, in the `return-from-trap` instruction
- so how does trap know what to execute? 
    - option1: caller specifies what to execute (addresses)
    - issue: once you are in, you can arbitarily execute any code
    - option2: kernel specifies what code to execute
    - issue: what code now?
        - machine first boots up in kernel mode
        - OS configures `trap handlers` 
        - reboot (not sure if this part is necessary)
        - processor remembers what to do incase of `interrupts`
- it should be obvious why `trap tables` can only be set in *priviledged mode*
- if a user process wants to edit the table, what does the OS do? adios!

as the image shows, there are two pahses: one for boting and one for usage by the programs

## Problem 2: timing switch
- crux: how does OS regain control of CPU (processor), so that it can switch processes?

### Approach: Cooperative
- While a process is executing, OS has no control over CPU
- OS regains control only by waiting for a system call OR when someone screws up (like divides by 0) and then the OS kills the process :)
- System calls are made when:
    - when the process runs too long, it calls the OS by itself
    - process wants to open/close file
    - process wants to talk to another machine
    - ...
- When OS is given the control back, it can decide what to do next; like run another program or continue running the one

### Approach: Non-Cooperative
- Problems: 
    - What if a process goes into an infinite loop?
    - What if a process goes rouge?
- Solving:
    - Option1: reboot!
    - Option2: timer interrupt
        - every x milliseconds, an interrupt is raised
        - OS has an **interrupt handler** to handle interrupts
- Timer interrupt configuration is a priviledged operation

### Saving & Restoring Context
- Once the OS gets the control back, the **scheduler** makes the decision whether to keep running the old process or switch to a new one.
- if **scheduler** decides to shift, OS runs **context switch** 
- OS saves the general purpose registers, program counter, kernel stack pointer
- Two typs of register saves/restores:
    - caused by **timer interrupt**: *user register state* of process is saved by hardware
    - casued by **task switching:** *kernel register state* is saved by the software (OS)
- "The latter action moves the system from running as if it just trapped into the kernel from A to as if it just trapped into the kernel from B."
