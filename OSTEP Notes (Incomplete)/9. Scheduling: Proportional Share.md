# 9. Scheduling: Proportional Share
###### tags: `OSTEP`

Here, we try to optimize the fair-ness, of running all jobs instead of looking at turnaround or response times.
Technique: **Lottery Scheduling**

## Lottery Scheduling
fair share un-deterministic sheduling

### Structure
- tickets == shares
- of out some total amount of tickets, each process gets some amount of tickets
- then, the OS picks one number randomly from [0, total-1]
- thus, the process having that ticket gets to execute


### Mechanisms
- **ticket currency**: users can have tickets and then assign the processes they want to run, with some share of the tickets they own; User A and User B have 100 and 150 tickets. User A can run 2 processes for 30 and 70 tickets each and B can run one process for all the 150 tickets it has. 
- **ticket transfer**: client/server senario (how and why does server care about the internals of the OS!?)
- **ticket inflation**: if a process wants, it can inflate the tickets and (somehow) get more CPU time

### Implementation
- Have a linked list of the jobs you have
- OS picks a random number from [0, total-1]
- OS then traverses the list; stopping right when current ticket total > random number picked
- To make this more efficient, we can sort the jobs by ticket counts they hold

### Metric
- **unfairness metric**: U = Time(fist job completes)/Time(second job completes)
- fair: U -> 1. Unfair: U -> 0

### Issues
- How to assign tickets? 
- Un-deterministic is pretty bad for small jobs

## Stride Scheduling
deterministic fair share scheduling

### Structure
- assign tickets (still an open problem)
- find **stride**: some-big-number/job-ticket-count
- init **pass-counter** for each job: counts how many times its been touched - the cost of it (say, could be 100) 
- Loop:
    - find least stride job
    - run the job
    - current-stride += pass-counter

### Issues
- what if a new job comes in? It'll have a pass value of 0, so it'll be able to monopolize the CPU usage.
- Thus, we have the issue of **global states**

## Applications
While its hard to assign tickets, it works in cases like a **virtualized data center**; having to run windows VM for 1/4 of cycle and Linux for the rest.
In general, one can find MLFQ more prominent in normal cases.
