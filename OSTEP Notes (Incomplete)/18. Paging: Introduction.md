# 18. Paging: Introduction
###### tags: `OSTEP`

Segmentation chops up the space into different sized chunks, making the space fragmented. Thus, allocating becomes more challenging.

Instead of splitting processes' address space into `code, stack, heap`, we divide into fixed sized units: **pages**. We can now call these fixed slots: **page-frames**

## Details
- Advantage: **flexibility**. We wont need to make any assumptions about directions of stack/heap.
- Advantage: **simplicity**. Dealing with free pages is easier; we can keep a free list.
- **page-table**: stores a per-process data - the *address translations*.
    - Example: VP (virtual page), PF (physical frame)
    - VP 0 -> PF3
    - VP 1 -> PF7
    - VP 2 -> PF5 ...
## virtual address translation

**offset**: $bits = log_2(Virtual\ Address\ Space\ Size) = log_2(64)$ 
**VPN**(virtual page number): $bits = VAS\ Size/Page\ Size = 64/16 = 4$
- Example: let virtual address = 21.
- This is $21_2 = 01\ 0101$
- $offset = 0101 = 5_{10}$
- $VPN = 01 = 1_{10}$
- Note the *VPN* is not used directly; we use the *page-table* to map the virtual page to the actual page number, using **PEN(physical frame number) === physical page number**
- Note the offset stays the same (i.e., it is not translated), because the offset just tells us which byte within the page we want. (taken directly)

## Page Tables
32 bit Address Space. 4KB Pages.
$\rightarrow offset = log_2(4KB) = log_2(4096) = 12$
$\rightarrow VPN = 32-12 = 20$

Now, assuming 4 bytes per **page table entry (PTE)**, we have $4\times 2^{20} (translations) = 4MB$

Now, for $100$ processes, we have $400MB$ of memory required! this is too much, even by todays standards.

So, what do we do when a problem arises? we ignore it. (for now :P)

## Page Table Organization
Data Structure: Array. $pagetable[VPN] = PFN$

- **present** bit **P**
- **read/write** bit **(R/W)** which determines if writes are allowed to this page
- **user/supervisor** bit **(U/S)**which determines if usermode processes can access the page
- few bits **(PWT, PCD, PAT, and G)** that determine how **hardware caching** works for these pages
- **accessed** bit **(A)** 
- **dirty** bit **(D)**
- **pageframe** number **(PFN)**.

## Paging: Slow
Assume for now that the virtual address translation is done at the hardware level.
