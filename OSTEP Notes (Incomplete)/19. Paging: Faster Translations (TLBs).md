# 19. Paging: Faster Translations (TLBs)
###### tags: `OSTEP`

> The Crux:How to speed up address translation?
> Can we speed up address translation, and generally avoid the extra memory reference that paging seems to require? What hardware support is required? What OS involvement is needed?

## TLB
**Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)** is a part of **Memory Management Unit (MMU)**, which is a *hardware cache* of virtual->physical address translation. aka **address translation cache**

### Example
we have:
- an array of 10 ints (4bytes)
- Virtual Address Space Size: 8 bits
- Virtual Address Start: 100
- 16 byte pages
- thus, to get 16byte/8bits = 16 pages, we have to get log(16) bits for VPN = 4
- thus, 4 bits offset for each of 15 bytes on a page

0. miss
1. hit
2. hit
3. miss
4. hit
5. hit
6. hit
7. miss
8. hit
9. hit

70% hit rate. in modern systems, page size is 4KB, so densely packed arrays have a *very good* hit rate

### Handling misses
CISC architectures had hardware based handling procedures. For modern RISC architectures, we have software managed TLB. In case of a miss, the hardware just raises an exception. this is handeled by the OS; by doing the following:
- pauses current instruction stream
- raises priviledge to kernel mode
- jumps to **trap handler**
- *return-from-trap* tell the hardware to resume instruction that caused that trap
- thus, this time its a hit!

There were some more details, which I didn't understand, so skipp.

### TLB Contents
An entry: ![](https://i.imgur.com/lrMjFRB.png)
this is called **fully associative**; and the hardware can search both of them parallely, to check for matches

Other bits: Valid(1/0)/Protection(r,w,x)/Dirty/Address-Space

### Context Switches
Recall that we have the processes think they are the only ones on the system; they have different mappings from Virtual->Physical Address Space. This is a problem now, since we cant use one's mappings to another.

Approach1: **Flush** the tlb on context switching. How? Set the valid bits to 0.
Issue: Each time a context switch happens, we have overheads.

Approach2: **Address Space Identifier (ASID)** can identify processes, much like **PID**, but takes 8 bits versus 32 bits for pid.

We can also have similar entries as in:

which perhaps we can compress further. this already has the benefit of using lesser pages; by resuing.

### Replacemet Policy
When the cache has been in use sufficiently, we have a decision to make: what old translation should we kick out?

Goal being: Maximize hit rate

Policy1: **Least Recently Used (LRU)**
Policy2: Random

### TLB IRL
too lazy to do.
