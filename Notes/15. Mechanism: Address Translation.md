# 15. Mechanism: Address Translation

Recall: 
- Goals
    - Efficiency of time and space
    - transparency (opaqueness)
    - protection

Technique: **(Hardware based address) translation**

## Assumptions
- User's address space is contiguous
- each address sapce is of the same size
- address space < physical memory size

## Example

```c++
int x;
x = 3;
```

is then taken as

`128: movl 0x0(%ebx), %eax`
`132: addl 0x03, %eax`
`135: addl %eax, 0x0(%ebx)`

note how the address is showing 128-135, which is from the virtual address space.

Now, we use the below formula to get the actual physical hardware mapping. the mechanism is thus called *address translation*: `physical address = virtual address + base`

Note how we used a **base** register. We use another register, **bound/limit** to add *protection*. How? the bound register tells if the process is trying to execute something outside of the scope.

These are the two special registers of the **MMU**, memory management unit.

## Bonus
- free list = empty solts. For the example above, we have [16-32 KB, 48-64 KB] slots free.
- When switching between processes, the OS has to save the vaules of the registers **base and bound** to **process control block** (PCB), where meta-information for each process is stored
- This above activity is *priviledged* for obvious reasons.
