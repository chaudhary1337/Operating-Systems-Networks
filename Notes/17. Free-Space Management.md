# 17. Free-Space Management
###### tags: `OSTEP`

Its easy to divide the address space into fixed size **pages** and then allocate them as needed. however, the problem becomes more interesting when we consider variable size memory spaces.

we discussed the issue of *internal fragmentation* and solved it using **segmentation**. we were then left at *external fragmentation*.

This is a rather obvious case of our problem. We have 20 bytes free, but we still can't allocate 15bytes!

> CRUX:
> How should free space be managed, when satisfying variable-sized re-quests? What strategies can be used to minimize fragmentation? Whatare the time and space overheads of alternate approaches?

## Details & Assumptions

- Data structure: `heap`
- Implementation: some kind of `free list`
- Goal: try to work around **external fragmentation**
- Assumptions: 
    - Since the allocated space is 'owned' by the program, we can't `compact` it more. (until ofcourse, its `free`-d)
    - the allocated space is **contiguous**

## Low level Mechanisms
- most allocators store some **header information**, which can be used for **integrity checking** as well as by `free()` during deallocation.
- **header information**:
    - *size of the block*: user_requested size (additional header size information is assumed. not stored. ) 
    - *magic number*: for integrity check

Now an obvious issue is that the memory is chopped up, and needs to be merged.

## Policies
| Fit | item in the list that is >= the request | features |
| - | - | - |
| best | smallest | O(n) search, reduces space waste |
| worst | largest | O(n) search, excess fragmentation |
| first | first | quick search, pollutes the list with small objects in the beginning |
| next | next | spreads the allocations |

## Other Approaces
- Segregated Lists
- Buddy allocation
