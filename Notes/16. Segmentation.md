# 16. Segmentation
###### tags: `OSTEP`

## Issues
- there is a bunch of free space in the middle going to waste
- we still haven't relaxed any assumptions

## Solution: Segmentation
- Generalised base/bounds
- Here, instead of going for separating out process by process, we separate by logical parts of the process; instead of [process1, process2, ...], we have [proc1stack, proc2heap, proc1code, ...] and so on. we have effictively broken the program into multiple parts and now allocating each part independently.

What is happening? Take a simple example.
Q: Find the physical address of heap, with current virtual address at 4200 and base address given 34K. The (base) heap virtual address is 4K.
A: offset = 4200-4K = 104 (how far away from the base do we look)
Thus, physical address = offset + base = 32K+104

**segmentation fault**: trying to access an address beyond premissioned address.

## Issues & Hardware Support
1. how to differentiate stack and heap and code? they all look the same to me!
2. even if you can differentiate between them, stack grows upwards. the base register doesn't make any sense to exist then. can we find the direction?
3. Yes, base/bound register helps protection. but what about more fine grained premissions, like Read/Write/eXecute?

## Fixing Issues
### Fixing 1

| Segment | bits |
| - | - |
| code | 00 |
| heap | 01 |
| stack | 11 |

### Fixing 2, 3

### Example
- Given
    - Virtual address: 15KB
    - Base address: 28KB
    - Max-allotments: 4KB
- Find physical address:
    - virtual address = $11\ 1100\ 0000\ 000$ (in bits)
    - top bits: $11 \rightarrow stack$ & growth = negative
    - offset = $1100\ 0000\ 0000 = 3KB$
    - negative-offset = max-allotment - offset = $1KB$
    - PA = VA - negative-offset = $28KB-1KB = 27KB$
    - DONE!

## Issues remain
**External Fragmentation**
A possible fix is to compactize the allocated spaces on the physical address. This however, takes a fair amount of processor time. So, we are stuck with other algorithms like **best-ft, worst-fit, buddy algorithm**.
