# 20. Paging: Smaller Tables
###### tags: `OSTEP`


> curx: how to make page tables smaller?
> Simple array-based page tables (usually called linear page tables) are too big, taking up far too much memory on typical systems. How can we make page tables smaller? What are the key ideas? What inefficiencies arise as a result of these new data structures?

## Solution 1: Bigger Pages
If each of the page is bigger, there are a lesser amount of pages that exist for a given memory in total. 

### Example
32 bit address space
16KB page size (over 4KB page size)
this allows for $log_2(16K) = log_2(16\times 1024) = 14$ pages, and $32-14=18$ bits remain for assigning VPNs.

We now have $2^{18}$ entries in the linear page table. Since each entry costs $4$ bytes, we have $4\times 2^{18} = 2^{20} = 1MB$ total size. This is a reduction by a factor of $4$, which is what we'd expect, for a $\times 4$ page size

### Issues
The issue is simple, as we had seen back in **segmentation**. The problem of *internal fragmentation*.

## Solution 2: Hybrid Approch: Paging + Segments
- Recall
    - Paging: one page table for the entire address space of a process
    - Segments: splitting the process in three parts (code, heap, stack) and then assigning different **base-bound** registers. (note that we consider the original case of all of them taking as in a contiguous memory space)

Now, we have the **base register** store the **physical address** of the **page table** *of that segment* (yes, there are now 3). The **bound register** indicates the **end** of the page table.

### Example
32 bit VAS
4KB pages
4 segment split (we use only three in this example, code, stack, heap)

As I mentioned, we now have 3 pairs of base-bound registers, instead of just one.

### Issues
As we discussed in segmentation, there is still unused space in between a page table.

To add, we now have extrenal fragmentation again, since allocation becomes a pain

## Solution 3: Multi-Level Page Tables
Goal: We want to get rid of large chunks of invalid memory regions

### Implementation
- divide the page table into page-sized units
- if the entire page of the PTE (page table entry) is invalid, don't allocate the page at all/
- to track the **validty**, we have a **page directory**
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/hnkdSrg.png)
- the **page directory** has **PDE (page directory entries)**, themselves having **PFN (page frame number)**, similar to PTE.
- Note: valid bit means that atleast one of the pointed to entries by the PFN is valid.
- Advantages:
    - compact: only allocates pages in proportion of addresses in use.
    - each portion of the page table fits neatly in a page, making it easy to manage memory.
- Disadvantage:
    - the space boost comes at the cost of time taken. we now need to compute another level of addresses; and that takes more time. (recall: TLB misses)
    - more space overheads

### Example
Given:

address space: 16KB
page size: 64 bytes

#### VPN, offset, total bits
num of pages that can be mapped = VPN = $log_2(16\times 2^{10}/64) = log_2(2^8) = 8$

total bits requied to map addresses = $log_2(total\ address\ space) = log_2(16\times 2^{10}) = 14$

offset bits = $14-8=6$

#### linear page table
$2^8 = 256$ entries
linear page table size = $256\times 4 Bytes = 1024 Bytes = 1 KB$

Since we have 64 Bytes of page table size, we can now assign the PTE into $1024/64=16$ pages.

#### Procedure
1. of the 16 pages, where is my required page? **PDI: page directory index**
2. of the page i get, which of the 64 Bytes of memory has my virtual page number? **VPN: virtual page number**
3. of the virtual page number i get, where in the page is the address i desire? **offset**

page directory index -> virtual page number -> offset

#### Extension
We are not limited to one level, right!

## Inverted Page Tables
## Swapping the Page Tables to Disk
We put some pages into the hard-disk to free up some ram.
