# 7. Scheduling: Introduction
###### tags: `OSTEP`

We explored the low level mechanisms, now we'll talk about the higher level sheduling decisions

## Workload Asusmptions
- workload = collective of all the processes running in the system
- the idea is to relax each of them one by one, to reach to the final stage: **fully operational scheduling discipline**
- processes == jobs
- Assumptions:
1. Each job runs for the same amount of time
2. All jobs arrive at the same time
3. All jobs only use the CPU (i.e., they perform no I/O)
4. The run-time of each job is known.

## Scheduling Metrics
- Performance Metrics
    - **turnaround time**: $T_{turnaround} = T_{completion} - T_{arrival}$
    - **turnaround time**: $T_{response} = T_{first-run} - T_{arrival}$
- Fairness: Jain's Fairness Index: Every job is important

## FIFO
- First In First Out
- All assumptions hold

## SJF
- Shortest Job First
- Breaking Assumption #1

## STCF
- Shortest Time to Completion First
- Breaking Assumption #2

Failure
- Good turnaround times, but bad response time (first run itself can take a lot of time)

## RR
- Round Robin
- Improving Response Times
- Technical Details:
    - time slice is a mutiple of the interrupt time
    - time slice cant be too large - becomes just like STCF
    - time slice cant be too small - overheads of context switching
    - time slice has to be the right amount to amortize the cost of switching

Failure
- Very good response times, Bad (awful) turnaround times
- high fairness, but not high performance

## I/O
- Breaking Asusmption #3
- Note how a process having to do I/O has to put the CPU on hold --- but for that process only!
